The files will not be able to be compiled without Husky in a cluster.
They are here as code samples.
With the 10.4G English Wikipedia corpus, this TF-IDF algprithm is 5 times faster than the TF-IDF algorithm on Spark and the advantage is even more significant when the datasets get larger.
Tested with the corpus with the first 10^9 bytes of the English Wikipedia of 954M, this Word2vec algorithm is more than 10 times faster than the Word2vec algorithm on Spark but comsuming more memory.
If interested, the powerpoint includes more information on the algorithms and performance.
